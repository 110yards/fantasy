# Release notes

**2021-08-18 - Commissioner functions**

* Commissioners can now change scoring settings for their league at any time.  If a commissioner changes scoring settings, a red transaction will appear in the league transaction log.  Scoring changes will not affect past weeks, nor will they affect games which are already complete.  **Please use with caution.**
* Commissioners can now change the name of rosters in their league.  Commissioner name changes will appear as red transactions in the transaction log.
* Commissioners can now ban a roster from future name changes, to prevent abuse.  Bans can also be removed by the commissioner.  Name changes bans do not appear in the transaction log.  Users will see an error alert if they attempt to change their roster name while banned.
* Commissioners can now enter "Commissioner mode" and manage other rosters in the league, allowing them to drop players, and move players on the roster (Commissioners cannot add or bid on players).  Drops and moves will appear as red transactions in the transaction log.  Commissioner mode can be enabled by clicking the "Enter Commissioner Mode" button at the bottom of a roster page.
